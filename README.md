VBScript in JavaScript
======================

This is an attempt to write a VBScript parser in JS.
The output is also JavaScript.

It's far from compelete, but it does compile the *.vbs files.


What
----

VBScript -> JS compiler, using the amazing [jison](http://jison.org) project.

This is my first time playing with a formal language definition. It's not pretty ;)


Why
---

I suggested that someone port their old, giant IE6 only application to modern browsers by simply, "writing a VBScript interpreter in JS".
That got me thinking about how hard it would be (hint: I underestimated it by a lot).

This project is the result of me hacking around with that idea for the past few days here and there.


When
----

Seriously, calling this abondon-ware is being kind. This is a **hack**, pure-and-simple. If someone wanted to run with it, be my guest, but don't expect it to do anything useful in it's current state.
